o	Notable Peaks: Reaches 3+ million on June 3 and ~2.82M on June 10, aligning with the overall top days.

4. Conclusions & Recommendations
1.	Key Revenue Drivers
o	Team A and Team B exert the strongest push on daily totals, so supporting these teams’ operations can yield larger shifts in total revenue.
2.	Critical Highs and Lows
o	June 3 (11.39M) and June 10 (10.88M) stand out as the top revenue days. Investigating marketing or operational events around those dates may provide insights for replicating that success.
o	June 22 marks the lowest total (~7.71M); it may be beneficial to determine if external factors, reduced promotions, or supply constraints contributed to that dip.
3.	Opportunities for Growth
o	Perishable (Rashed), though fairly stable, shows potential to surge alongside A/B under the right circumstances (e.g., June 3, June 10). Targeted synergy with marketing could boost these spikes further.
o	Team C (Mehboob), while smallest in raw figures, can still capitalize on busy market days. Strategies that tie Team C’s offerings to bigger promotional events might help narrow the gap.
4.	Future Monitoring
o	Day-by-day tracking of operational changes, seasonal factors, and promotions can pinpoint why certain days see leaps or drops in multiple teams’ revenues simultaneously.
o	Continue weekly or even daily reviews of each team’s numbers to detect oncoming dips earlier and sustain momentum after high-performing days.
By closely analyzing each team's day-to-day progress and the combined effect on Total Revenue, the organization can tailor its strategies—promotional timing, resource allocation, and supply chain adjustments—to sustain the strongest performance periods and mitigate dips in sales.
