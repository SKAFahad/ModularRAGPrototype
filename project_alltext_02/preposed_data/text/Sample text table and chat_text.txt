(Covering 20220528 to 20220627) Below is a detailed narrative of daily revenue swings, team-specific rises and dips, and overall performance patterns across the month-long period. The data includes four teams—Team A (Faria), Team B (Mustafiz), Team C (Mehboob), and Perishable (Rashed)—plus a Total Revenue column.  1. Overall Month Summary 1)	Total Revenue Range 	--	Over this 31-day interval, Total Revenue fluctuates between roughly 7.7 million (on June 22, its lowest) and above 11.3 million (on June 3, its highest). 	--	The sharpest surge occurs in the first week of June, after which mid-June shows moderate ups and downs, leading to a slight dip in the final week. 2)	Team Contributions 	--	Team A (Faria) and Team B (Mustafiz) consistently command the highest revenue shares, each often 2+ million daily. On certain days, either team can surpass 3 or even 4 million, heavily influencing total daily revenue. 	--	Perishable (Rashed) usually lands in the 2–3 million range, contributing notably but with fewer dramatic swings than Teams A/B. 	--	Team C (Mehboob) remains the smallest contributor, typically 600k–900k a day, but still fluctuates along with overall trends.  2. Week-by-Week & Daily Ups/Downs Week 1: May 28 – June 3 1)	May 28 (Start Point) 	--	Total Revenue: 8.99 million 	--	Team A: 3.11M, Team B: 2.69M, Team C: 0.76M, Perishable: 2.30M 	--	Key Observation: A strong baseline day; Teams A and B already near the 3M mark, buoying the total close to 9M. 2)	May 29–30 	--	Slight Dip Overall: Total drops to ~8.38M by May 29 and 8.48M by May 30. 	--	Team A slides a bit from 3.11M to around 2.92–2.97M; Team B dips to ~2.38–2.52M. 	--	Main Driver: Perishable hovers ~2.14–2.22M, keeping the daily totals from falling too far. 3)	May 31 – June 1 	--	May 31: A modest rebound to 8.75M total; Team A up to 3.21M, Team B near 2.53M. 	--	June 1: Total spikes at 9.77M. Notably, Team A surpasses 3.6M, and Team B crosses 2.82M. 	--	Surge Factor: Both Team C and Perishable inch up, too—Team C around 0.83M, Perishable near 2.39M. 4)	June 2 – June 3 (Major Peaks) 	--	June 2: Total hits 9.66M. Team A stays above 3.47M; Team B near 2.77M; Perishable ~2.47M. 	--	June 3 (Highest Day): Reaches 11.39 million overall. 		--	Team A: ~3.79M 		--	Team B: ~3.45M 		--	Perishable: ~3.09M 		--	Team C: ~0.92M 	--	Highlight: This is the largest daily revenue in the entire dataset, marking a sharp collective rise across all teams.  Week 2: June 4 – June 10 1)	June 4–5 	--	June 4: Total remains high at 9.75M, supported by 3.25M from Team A, ~2.98M from Team B, and ~2.41M from Perishable. 	--	June 5: A slight dip to 8.40M, partly because Team A slides below 2.88M. Team B also dips to ~2.46M. 2)	June 6–7 	--	June 6: Total rebounds above 9.47M. Team A crosses 3.32M, Team B near 2.75M, with Team C steady at ~0.70M. 	--	June 7: Another uptick to 9.37M (Team A ~3.25M, Team B ~2.61M), showing a mild day-to-day fluctuation but still maintaining a high level. 3)	June 8–9 	--	June 8: 8.76M in total, with minor dips in Team A and Team B, though Perishable remains above 2.26M. 	--	June 9: Jumps to 8.61M. Team B hovers around 2.36M, while Team A dips slightly to ~2.99M. However, Perishable spikes to around 2.48M, offsetting the small drops from others. 4)	June 10 (Another Peak) 	--	Total Revenue soars to 10.88M, the second-highest day in this dataset. 	--	Team A crosses 4.05M, while Team B jumps to 3.13M. Perishable sees a sizeable jump to ~2.82M. 	--	Key Driver: Nearly all teams exhibit daily highs, echoing the synergy seen on June 3.  Week 3: June 11 – June 17 1)	June 11–12 	--	June 11: Total at ~9.42M, led by a strong 3.46M from Team A and 2.78M from Team B. 	--	June 12: Slight drop to 8.12M, as Team A dips below 3.06M and Team B near 2.27M. Perishable also retreats to ~2.10M. 2)	June 13–14 	--	June 13: 8.05M total; Team A ~2.88M, Team B ~2.35M, with consistent Perishable revenue near 2.04M. 	--	June 14: A mild rise to 8.15M, driven by Team A at ~2.97M and B at ~2.26M. 	--	Note: These mid-range daily totals reflect neither extreme highs nor deep lows; stable day-to-day transitions. 3)	June 15–17 	--	June 15: ~7.99M total, a slight downshift caused by dips across Teams A, B, and C. 	--	June 16: Moves close to 7.80M, marking a short-term low; Team A is below 2.80M, Team B near 2.12M. 	--	June 17: Rallies up to ~8.80M, with Team A at 3.20M, Perishable jumping to 2.57M—helping recoup part of the midweek losses.  Week 4: June 18 – June 24 1)	June 18 (Near 9.61M) 	--	A strong day overall. Team A pushes to 3.52M, and B to 2.64M. Perishable is ~2.55M, solidifying a near 9.61M total. 2)	June 19–20 	--	June 19: Falls slightly to 8.57M, with Team A at 3.24M, B at 2.38M, Perishable at 2.14M. 	--	June 20: Climbs back above 8.28M—Team A still near 3.07M. 3)	June 21–22 	--	June 21: ~7.97M. Minor retreats in Team A/B keep total under 8M. 	--	June 22 (Low Point): 7.71M total. Team A dips to 2.67M, B ~2.28M, and the rest also subdued—lowest combined day in the entire series. 4)	June 23–24 	--	June 23: Slight bounce to 7.94M, with Team B near 2.36M, Perishable ~2.05M. 	--	June 24: Surges to ~9.23M, thanks to Team A near 3.10M, Team B ~2.88M, and Perishable ~2.31M—one of the largest single-day recoveries in the series.  Week 5: June 25 – June 27 1)	June 25 – 26 	--	June 25: 9.06M total. Team A at 3.13M, B at 2.92M, with Perishable around 2.27M. Team C dips to ~0.73M, but the rest maintain higher levels. 	--	June 26: Rises again to ~8.68M, though Team A sees a minor slip from 3.12M to 3.03M, offset by Team B nearing 2.52M. 2)	June 27 (Final Day) 	--	Closes on a robust note at 8.18M. Team A climbs to 2.82M, B at 2.35M, Perishable ~2.25M, and Team C at 0.74M. 	--	Though slightly lower than the previous day, it remains solidly above the dataset’s lower bound.  3. Team-Specific Observations 1)	Team A (Faria) 	--	Highest Surges: June 3 (3.79M) and June 10 (4.05M) are standout peaks, exceeding 3.5M multiple times across the month. 	--	Significant Dips: Slips below 2.80M around June 16–17 but bounces back quickly. 2)	Team B (Mustafiz) 	--	Consistent Top-Tier: Often the second-largest contributor, commonly in the 2.3–3.1M range. 	--	Major Influence: Days when Team B crosses ~3M (June 3, June 10) coincide with overall revenue spikes. 3)	Team C (Mehboob) 	--	Smaller Scale: Typically 600–900k daily, rarely above 900k but occasionally dips below 700k on slower days. 	--	Stable Pattern: Changes in Team C’s revenue are less dramatic yet show upturns during the big surges in early/mid-June. 4)	Perishable (Rashed) 	--	2–3M Range: Adds a sizable third layer of revenue. 	--	Notable Peaks: Reaches 3+ million on June 3 and ~2.82M on June 10, aligning with the overall top days.  4. Conclusions & Recommendations 1)	Key Revenue Drivers 	--	Team A and Team B exert the strongest push on daily totals, so supporting these teams’ operations can yield larger shifts in total revenue. 2)	Critical Highs and Lows 	--	June 3 (11.39M) and June 10 (10.88M) stand out as the top revenue days. Investigating marketing or operational events around those dates may provide insights for replicating that success. 	--	June 22 marks the lowest total (~7.71M); it may be beneficial to determine if external factors, reduced promotions, or supply constraints contributed to that dip. 3)	Opportunities for Growth 	--	Perishable (Rashed), though fairly stable, shows potential to surge alongside A/B under the right circumstances (e.g., June 3, June 10). Targeted synergy with marketing could boost these spikes further. 	--	Team C (Mehboob), while smallest in raw figures, can still capitalize on busy market days. Strategies that tie Team C’s offerings to bigger promotional events might help narrow the gap. 4)	Future Monitoring 	--	Day-by-day tracking of operational changes, seasonal factors, and promotions can pinpoint why certain days see leaps or drops in multiple teams’ revenues simultaneously. 	--	Continue weekly or even daily reviews of each team’s numbers to detect oncoming dips earlier and sustain momentum after high-performing days. By closely analyzing each team's day-to-day progress and the combined effect on Total Revenue, the organization can tailor its strategies—promotional timing, resource allocation, and supply chain adjustments—to sustain the strongest performance periods and mitigate dips in sales.
