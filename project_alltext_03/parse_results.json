Team-Specific Observations\n1.\tTeam A (Faria)\no\tHighest Surges: June 3 (3.79M) and June 10 (4.05M) are standout peaks, exceeding 3.5M multiple times across the month.\no\tSignificant Dips: Slips below 2.80M around June 16\u201317 but bounces back quickly.\n2.\tTeam B (Mustafiz)\no\tConsistent Top-Tier: Often the second-largest contributor, commonly in the 2.3\u20133.1M range.\no\tMajor Influence: Days when Team B crosses ~3M (June 3, June 10) coincide with overall revenue spikes.\n3.\tTeam C (Mehboob)\no\tSmaller Scale: Typically 600\u2013900k daily, rarely above 900k but occasionally dips below 700k on slower days.\no\tStable Pattern: Changes in Team C\u2019s revenue are less dramatic yet show upturns during the big surges in early/mid-June.\n4.\tPerishable (Rashed)\no\t2\u20133M Range: Adds a sizable third layer of revenue.\no\tNotable Peaks: Reaches 3+ million on June 3 and ~2.82M on June 10, aligning with the overall top days.\n\n4. Conclusions & Recommendations\n1.\tKey Revenue Drivers\no\tTeam A and Team B exert the strongest push on daily totals, so supporting these teams\u2019 operations can yield larger shifts in total revenue.\n2.\tCritical Highs and Lows\no\tJune 3 (11.39M) and June 10 (10.88M) stand out as the top revenue days. Investigating marketing or operational events around those dates may provide insights for replicating that success.\no\tJune 22 marks the lowest total (~7.71M); it may be beneficial to determine if external factors, reduced promotions, or supply constraints contributed to that dip.\n3.\tOpportunities for Growth\no\tPerishable (Rashed), though fairly stable, shows potential to surge alongside A/B under the right circumstances (e.g., June 3, June 10). Targeted synergy with marketing could boost these spikes further.\no\tTeam C (Mehboob), while smallest in raw figures, can still capitalize on busy market days. Strategies that tie Team C\u2019s offerings to bigger promotional events might help narrow the gap.\n4.\tFuture Monitoring\no\tDay-by-day tracking of operational changes, seasonal factors, and promotions can pinpoint why certain days see leaps or drops in multiple teams\u2019 revenues simultaneously.\no\tContinue weekly or even daily reviews of each team\u2019s numbers to detect oncoming dips earlier and sustain momentum after high-performing days.\nBy closely analyzing each team's day-to-day progress and the combined effect on Total Revenue, the organization can tailor its strategies\u2014promotional timing, resource allocation, and supply chain adjustments\u2014to sustain the strongest performance periods and mitigate dips in sales.\n",

June 10 (Another Peak) \no Total Revenue soars to 10.88M, the second-highest day in this dataset. \no Team A crosses 4.05M, while Team B jumps to 3.13M. Perishable sees a sizeable jump to ~2.82M. \no Key Driver: Nearly all teams exhibit daily highs, echoing the synergy seen on June 3. \n \nWeek 3: June 11 \u2013 June 17 \n1. June 11\u201312 \no June 11: Total at ~9.42M, led by a strong 3.46M from Team A and 2.78M from Team B. \no June 12: Slight drop to 8.12M, as Team A dips below 3.06M and Team B near 2.27M. Perishable also retreats to ~2.10M. \n2. June 13\u201314 \no June 13: 8.05M total; Team A ~2.88M, Team B ~2.35M, with consistent Perishable revenue near 2.04M. \no June 14: A mild rise to 8.15M, driven by Team A at ~2.97M and B at ~2.26M. \no Note: These mid-range daily totals reflect neither extreme highs nor deep lows; stable day-to-day transitions. \n3. June 15\u201317 \no June 15: ~7.99M total, a slight downshift caused by dips across Teams A, B, and C. \no June 16: Moves close to 7.80M, marking a short-term low; Team A is below 2.80M, Team B near 2.12M.\n\no June 17: Rallies up to ~8.80M, with Team A at 3.20M, Perishable jumping to 2.57M\u2014helping recoup part of the midweek \nlosses. \n \nWeek 4: June 18 \u2013 June 24 \n1. June 18 (Near 9.61M) \no A strong day overall. Team A pushes to 3.52M, and B to 2.64M. Perishable is ~2.55M, solidifying a near 9.61M total. \n2. June 19\u201320 \no June 19: Falls slightly to 8.57M, with Team A at 3.24M, B at 2.38M, Perishable at 2.14M. \no June 20: Climbs back above 8.28M\u2014Team A still near 3.07M. \n3. June 21\u201322 \no June 21: ~7.97M. Minor retreats in Team A/B keep total under 8M. \no June 22 (Low Point): 7.71M total. Team A dips to 2.67M, B ~2.28M, and the rest also subdued\u2014lowest combined day in the \nentire series. \n4. June 23\u201324 \no June 23: Slight bounce to 7.94M, with Team B near 2.36M, Perishable ~2.05M. \no June 24: Surges to ~9.23M, thanks to Team A near 3.10M, Team B ~2.88M, and Perishable ~2.31M\u2014one of the largest single-\nday recoveries in the series. \n \nWeek 5: June 25 \u2013 June 27 \n1. June 25 \u2013 26 \no June 25: 9.06M total. Team A at 3.13M, B at 2.92M, with Perishable around 2.27M. Team C dips to ~0.73M, but the rest \nmaintain higher levels. \no June 26: Rises again to ~8.68M, though Team A sees a minor slip from 3.12M to 3.03M, offset by Team B nearing 2.52M.\n\n2. June 27 (Final Day) \no Closes on a robust note at 8.18M. Team A climbs to 2.82M, B at 2.35M, Perishable ~2.25M, and Team C at 0.74M. \no Though slightly lower than the previous day, it remains solidly above the dataset\u2019s lower bound. \n \n3. Team-Specific Observations \n1. Team A (Faria) \no Highest Surges: June 3 (3.79M) and June 10 (4.05M) are standout peaks, exceeding 3.5M multiple times across the month. \no Significant Dips: Slips below 2.80M around June 16\u201317 but bounces back quickly. \n2. Team B (Mustafiz) \no Consistent Top-Tier: Often the second-largest contributor, commonly in the 2.3\u20133.1M range. \no Major Influence: Days when Team B crosses ~3M (June 3, June 10) coincide with overall revenue spikes. \n3. Team C (Mehboob) \no Smaller Scale: Typically 600\u2013900k daily, rarely above 900k but occasionally dips below 700k on slower days. \no Stable Pattern: Changes in Team C\u2019s revenue are less dramatic yet show upturns during the big surges in early/mid-June. \n4. Perishable (Rashed) \no 2\u20133M Range: Adds a sizable third layer of revenue. \no Notable Peaks: Reaches 3+ million on June 3 and ~2.82M on June 10, aligning with the overall top days. \n \n4. Conclusions & Recommendations \n1. Key Revenue Drivers \no Team A and Team B exert the strongest push on daily totals, so supporting these teams\u2019 operations can yield larger shifts in total \nrevenue.\n\n2. Critical Highs and Lows \no June 3 (11.39M) and June 10 (10.88M) stand out as the top revenue days. Investigating marketing or operational events around \nthose dates may provide insights for replicating that success. \no June 22 marks the lowest total (~7.71M); it may be beneficial to determine if external factors, reduced promotions, or supply \nconstraints contributed to that dip. \n3. Opportunities for Growth \no Perishable (Rashed), though fairly stable, shows potential to surge alongside A/B under the right circumstances (e.g., June 3, \nJune 10). Targeted synergy with marketing could boost these spikes further. \no Team C (Mehboob), while smallest in raw figures, can still capitalize on busy market days. Strategies that tie Team C\u2019s offerings \nto bigger promotional events might help narrow the gap. \n4. Future Monitoring \no Day-by-day tracking of operational changes, seasonal factors, and promotions can pinpoint why certain days see leaps or drops \nin multiple teams\u2019 revenues simultaneously. \no Continue weekly or even daily reviews of each team\u2019s numbers to detect oncoming dips earlier and sustain momentum after \nhigh-performing days. \nBy closely analyzing each team's day-to-day progress and the combined effect on Total Revenue, the organization can tailor its strategies\u2014\npromotional timing, resource allocation, and supply chain adjustments\u2014to sustain the strongest performance periods and mitigate dips in sales.",
