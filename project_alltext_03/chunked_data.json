Critical Highs and Lows o June 3\n(11.39M) and June 10 (10.88M) stand out as the top revenue days. Investigating\nmarketing or operational events around those dates may provide insights for\nreplicating that success. o June 22 marks the lowest total (~7.71M); it may be\nbeneficial to determine if external factors, reduced promotions, or supply\nconstraints contributed to that dip. 3. Opportunities for Growth o Perishable\n(Rashed), though fairly stable, shows potential to surge alongside A/B under the\nright circumstances (e.g., June 3, June 10). Targeted synergy with marketing\ncould boost these spikes further. o Team C (Mehboob), while smallest in raw\nfigures, can still capitalize on busy market days. Strategies that tie Team C\u2019s\nofferings to bigger promotional events might help narrow the gap. 4. Future\nMonitoring o Day-by-day tracking of operational changes, seasonal factors, and\npromotions can pinpoint why certain days see leaps or drops in multiple teams\u2019\nrevenues simultaneously. o Continue weekly or even daily reviews of each team\u2019s\nnumbers to detect oncoming dips earlier and sustain momentum after high-\nperforming days. By closely analyzing each team's day-to-day progress and the\ncombined effect on Total Revenue, the organization can tailor its\nstrategies\u2014promotional timing, resource allocation, and supply chain\nadjustments\u2014to sustain the strongest performance periods and mitigate dips in\nsales.",
